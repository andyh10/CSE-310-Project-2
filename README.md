# CSE-310-Project-2

Authors: Ann Joby, Andy Huynh

Project 2 involves getting a .txt file that contains # of vertices, # of edges, and vertices and their bridges to another.

With this information we have to (1) make an adjacency matrix, (2) show the odd vertices, and (3) use dijkstra's algorithm on all of the odd vertices.
